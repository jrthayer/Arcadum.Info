# NavBar
Files for the NavBar being used on the site

## Features
1. Makes use of css variables for dynamic coloring
2. Has drop down nav links that toggle link groups on/off
3. Collapses properly for mobile devices

## Potential Improvements
- [ ] Rearrange link expansion, currently expands below parent element which pushes all other elements down. Instead should show children links off to the side of the parent so it doesn't affect the other link groups. 

- [ ] Currently each webpage has a static instance of the navBar, could dynamically generate it or maybe look into node.js.
