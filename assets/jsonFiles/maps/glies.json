The city is currently governed by Lord Azolon, who serves as the Archmage of the Mages Guild he established in Glies.\n\nIn the 50 years after the Calamity, Glies experienced two important historical events. The first one is the strange behavior of the Mists, a strange and dangerous phenomena that used to be limited to the surrounding environment of the Titan’s Eye, with its movement Westward. The second is the unification of the Eastern Kingdoms into the Eclipse, by warlord Otami Kurosai."
